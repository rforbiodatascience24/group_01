dogmaR is a an R package for dealing with biological sequences and their common transformations in the context of the central dogma of molecular biology. That is the processes replicating DNA, transcribing it into RNA and translating it into amino acids

# Making DNA

Often you, the user, would have a particular sequence of interest but in case you do not, dogmaR can generate a random one for you using the make_DNA command. To use it you simply specify the number of bases you would like as as shown in the example below:

```{r, make_DNA}
library(dogmaR)
make_DNA(12)
```

# Transcribing RNA

The first step of converting the genetic information stored in DNA into molecules that act is transcribing the DNA into RNA. To simulate this process, where thymidin is replaced by uracil in the sequence you can use the dna_to_rna function as shown in the example below:

```{r, transcribe}
dna_to_rna("ATCCAATCCACT")
```

# Translating RNA to Proteins

To translate an RNA sequence into a a peptide sequence, the list of codons must first be identified, which can be done using the get_codons function, as described below:

```{r, find codons}
# transcribe in reading frame 1
get_codons("AUCCAAUCCACU",start=1)

# transcribe in reading frame 2
get_codons("AUCCAAUCCACU",start=2)

#transcribe in reading frame 3
get_codons("AUCCAAUCCACU",start=3)
```

This list of codons can then be translated into a peptide sequence using the get_aa_from_codons function, as illustrated in the example below:

```{r, translate}
# transcribe in reading frame 1

# get a vector of codons from a sequence using the get_codons function
codon_vector <- get_codons("AUCCAAUCCACU",start=1)

# translate the codons
get_aa_from_codon(codon_vector)
```

A combination of the previous these functions can thus be used to illustrate all steps of the central dogma of molecular biology

```{r, the central dogma}
DNA <- make_DNA(15)
RNA <- dna_to_rna(DNA)
codons <- get_codons(RNA)
aa_seq <- get_aa_from_codon(codons)

codon_str <- paste(codons,collapse=" ")     
paste0("The DNA sequence ", DNA, " is transcribed into ",RNA," which contains the following codons ",codon_str," which are translated into the following amino acid sequence ",aa_seq)
```

# Visualizing sequence compositions

If you are interested in visualizing the sequence composition of whatever sequence you are working with, DNA, RNA or amino acid the function plot_seq_composition can help you:

```{r}
DNA <- make_DNA(30)
RNA <- dna_to_rna(DNA)
codons <- get_codons(RNA)
aa_seq <- get_aa_from_codon(codons)


plot_seq_composition(DNA)

plot_seq_composition(aa_seq)
```

## Installation

You can install the development version of dogmaR from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("rforbiodatascience24/group_01_package")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example}
library(dogmaR)
## basic example code
```

What is special about using `README.Rmd` instead of just `README.md`? You can include R chunks like so:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

You'll still need to render `README.Rmd` regularly, to keep `README.md` up-to-date. `devtools::build_readme()` is handy for this.

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo = FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

In that case, don't forget to commit and push the resulting figure files, so they display on GitHub and CRAN.
